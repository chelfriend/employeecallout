Data preprocessing: Prepare your dataset, encode categorical variables (like reasons for calling out), and split it into training and testing sets.
Build the neural network architecture: Define the structure of your neural network including the input layer, hidden layers, and output layer.
Compile the model: Choose an appropriate loss function and optimizer.
Train the model: Fit the model to the training data.
Evaluate the model: Test the model's performance on the testing data.
